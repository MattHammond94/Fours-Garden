# Fours-Garden

___A portfolio style website for an artist to showcase their work and provide information___

## Build 
Website was scaffolded using vite and built using react, jsx and vanilla CSS.

## Design
Due to the site being mostly static (The site obviously has some interactive elements and some functionality/validation) I didn't feel the need to write a comprehensive recipe or design plan. I wanted to learn by doing and by resolving mistakes and and when they arose. 

I did however compose a diagram, to get what I saw in my head into a visual that I could work from. This can be viewed in the prelim-files dir.

There is enough scope to return to this project to make the site both informative and an e-commerce site. The store side would likely require a backend and this upgrade to the existing codebase would likely require some further planning.

## Notes 
The core focus of this project was making something that looked fantastic(using purely vanilla CSS), making something that was responsive and making something that could easilly be deployed and showcased. I made this choice due to having little experience in all of these areas and felt like they were the final pieces in being truly full stack.
