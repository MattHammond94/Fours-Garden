# Fours-Garden

___A portfolio style website for an artist to showcase their work and provide information___

___Site has now been deployed using netilfy and can be accessed viewed here: https://fours-garden.netlify.app/___

## Build 
Website was scaffolded using vite and built using react, jsx and vanilla CSS.

## Design
Due to the site being a static informational project that does not require a backend. I didn't feel the need to write a comprehensive recipe or design plan. In this project I wanted to focus on UI and web design. I wanted to learn by doing and resolving mistakes when they arose. 

The core focus of this project was making something that looked fantastic(using purely vanilla CSS), making something that was responsive and making something that could easilly be deployed and showcased. I made this choice due to having little experience in all of these areas and felt like they were the final pieces required in me being truly full stack.

I composed a diagram using excalidraw, to get what I saw in my head into a visual that I could work from. This can be viewed in the prelim-files dir.

There is enough scope to return to this project, adding an e-commerce store. The store would likely require a backend and this upgrade to the existing codebase would likely require some further planning.
